# GenomeRx – Smart Genomic Insight for Antibiotic Selection

## 📌 Project Overview
**GenomeRx** is a smart genomic analysis platform designed to predict antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from genomic data and recommend effective antibiotics.  
It provides an interactive dashboard for doctors, researchers, and lab staff to upload genome sequences, run ML-powered AMR predictions, and generate clinical reports.

This system was developed as part of an academic software engineering project to showcase the integration of **machine learning**, **bioinformatics**, and **clinical decision support** in a secure and scalable application.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🔐 **Role-based Authentication** – Admin, Doctor, Researcher, Lab Staff
- 📂 **Genome Upload** – Supports FASTA, CSV, PDF with validation
- 🤖 **AMR Prediction** – Uses **Random Forest** and **SVM** ML models with confidence scores
- 💊 **Top-3 Antibiotic Recommendations** – Based on prediction results
- 📊 **Visualization** – Confidence charts, resistance gene matches, history tracking
- 📝 **Clinical Reports** – Exportable to PDF with notes & tags
- 📜 **Task & Calendar Management** – Assign tasks, set deadlines, manage lab activities
- 💬 **Internal Chat** – Role-based direct messaging
- ⚙️ **Admin Tools** – User management, password reset, deactivate accounts
- 🌗 **Light/Dark Theme Support**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Vite, TailwindCSS, ShadCN/UI, Lucide Icons, Recharts, Framer Motion)  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)  
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest, SVM (scikit-learn)  
- **Database:** SQLite / MySQL  
- **UI Prototype:** Figma + custom design  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
